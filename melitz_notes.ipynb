    "Suppose that now there are two countries that engage in trade. Each country, $i$, $i=1,2$, has a population of $\\bar{l_i}$ and a measure of potential firms $\\mu_i$. Firms' productivities are again distributed according to the Pareto distribution, $F(x) = 1-x^{-\\gamma}$. A firm in country $i$ faces a fixed cost of exporting to country $j$, $j\\neq i$, of $f_e$, where $f_e > f_d = f$. Each country also imposes an *ad valorem* tariff $\\tau$ on imports of differentiated goods from the other country. The revenues from these tarrifs is redistributed in lump-sum form to the consumer in that country. Define an equilibrium for this world economy. "
